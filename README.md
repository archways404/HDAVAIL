# Project Name (TBD)

## Summary
Need to edit this part a bit...

## Overview
The project aims to streamline the scheduling process for employees over at the Malmö University Student Helpdesk, but we plan on adding support for ex: Teaching-Assistants that will be included in version 2.0.

### Problem Solved
The project replaces the current cumbersome method of manually emailing availability to the supervisor and helps automatically generate a schedule template. Employees can then select the slots they are available for, and the supervisor can make assignments from a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the system integrates with Google Calendar to allow workers to sync their schedules to their phones, ensuring that any changes to the schedule are always reflected without manual intervention.

The system also includes robust features like automated database backups, trade request management, handling situations where employees can no longer work their assigned slots, and email notifications for schedule updates and changes.

## Features
- Automatic schedule generation based on employee availability.
- Easy slot selection for employees.
- Neat UI for supervisors to assign slots.
- Integration with Google Calendar via a sync link.
- Future support for booking Teachers and Teaching Assistants.
- Automated Database backups.
- Trade requests.
- Email notifications.
